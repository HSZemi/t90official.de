                    T90 Titans League returns bigger and better than ever! This recurring competition provides a
                    consistent, high-level stage for established pros to sharpen their skills, while giving newcomers
                    the chance to prove themselves and break into the top tier. Across the first four Seasons, 24
                    players competed in both the Platinum and Gold Leagues, with Silver serving as a qualifier. For
                    Season 5, the format expands: Silver becomes a full league, and Bronze takes its place as the
                    qualifier, opening the door for 24 more players to battle through a full group stage and climb the
                    ladder. With a $100,000 prize pool spread across more than 100 competitors, T90 Titans League
                    delivers one of the most open and rewarding pathways into the Age of Empires pro scene.

                    and joined by the top 112 players from the sign ups. They will then be split to form 8 small

                    <li>Adjustment: Elo adjustment for losing against higher elo players on a smurf account. Elo can
                        also be gained/lost in non-smurf matchups.
                    </li>
                    <li>Penalty: Elo adjustment for dodging (-16 per dodge) and losing on a smurf account (equal to the

                        <p>Player A has an account and 2700 Elo, and a smurf account at 2300 Elo. While playing on
                            their smurf account, they match up against Player B, who has only one account at 2300 Elo.
                            Player A
                            wins the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>On the regular ladder, the Elo change is based on the accounts the players use for that
                            specific
                            game. Player A gains 16 Elo, and Player B loses 16 Elo.
                        </p>
                        <p>On the T90 Titans League ladder, player A does not get any points because they played on a
                            smurf
                            account. The Elo change for player B is adjusted based on the ranking of the highest account
                            of
                            player A. So Player B would lose 16 Elo, but get an adjustment of + 8 Elo to reflect that
                            they would
                            only lose ~ 8 Elo if they lost to Player A on their main account.
