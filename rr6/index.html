                    Regicide Rumble is back better than ever! For the sixth time, players of all skill levels will
                    battle on a variety of different maps, carefully considering if they want to win through diplomacy
                    or kill off as many enemy kings as possible!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just like the 5th edition, there will be 2 community days (July 9th &amp; July 10th), 2 pro days (July
                    11th and July 12th) and a finals day (July 13th). There are 2 finals: One for players with the most
                    king snipes who didnâ€™t win their game, and one grand final for all the winners from the first 4
                    days. The total prize pool of $4500+ is sponsored by Forte Strategists.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Regicide Rumble games will be played on maps that are suited for regicide diplomacy settings. Maps
                    will not be released until after players are placed and schedule is set. Players can win by defeating everyone,
                    collecting all the relics for a relic victory, or building a wonder for a wonder victory.
                </p>

                <div class="notification is-info is-light">
                    ðŸ›ˆ All maps are available in the official
                    <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/397251/"><b>Regicide Rumble 6 Mod</b></a>.<br>
                    The host <b>must</b> select this data mod when creating the lobby.
                    Otherwise, the maps will not be available.
                </div>

                <p>
                    With the mod, Donjons and Towers (Watch Tower, Guard Tower, Keep, Bombard Tower)
                    take up 1 population space. This is to discourage turtling ðŸ™‚
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before the match starts, 10 civilizations are banned globally to ensure good variety between
                    different games. After this, civilizations are picked by all players in the match in order from
                    lowest 1v1 elo to highest 1v1 elo. In the event that a competitor has less than 10 ranked 1v1s their
                    order is decided by moderator discretion. Like Regicide Rumble V, players will not start with a
                    castle due to DE's "Regicide Mode" which will ensure greater balance of civilizations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The admins will handle selecting the host, server, and ensuring lobby settings are correct.
                    However, here are 2 screenshots of the correct

                <h2 id="regicide-rules">Regicide Rules</h2>

                <p>
                    The following extra rules apply to ensure a fun, fair game for everyone:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players must not resign</li>
                    <li>Players may not delete their king, or delete a transport ship with their own king in it</li>
                    <li>Allied victory is not allowed</li>
                    <li>Players may not receive any information from outside sources</li>
                    <li>Players can not have any streams open while playing the regicide rumble game</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Admins hold the final decision on individual situations. Not following these rules may lead to a
                    (partial) prize pool deduction.
                </p>

                <h2 id="schedule-and-prize-money">Schedule &amp; Prize Money</h2>

                <p>
                    Two games are played each day of Regicide Rumble VI. Game 2 will start about 20 minutes after game 1
                    is finished, so we ask players to keep an eye on the first game of the day to ensure they are ready
                    to go.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Game 1 - 16 GMT / 12pm EST</li>
                    <li>Game 2 - 18:30 GMT / 14:30 EST (Approximately)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Players will get $25 per king snipe. In a case where it is unclear which player is responsible for
                    sniping a king, admins have the final decision. Placements are based on the time survived in the
                    game. In case a player wins with a relic or wonder victory, 2nd and 3rd place are based on the
                    highest score of players that are still alive when the game ends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The winners from each game will be invited to play the Grand Final. The 8 players who did not win
                    their game with the most kingsnipes will be invited for the kingsnipe final. In case of a tie, T90
                    and Rbase96 will decide which players will be invited. The kingsnipe final is the first game on
                    July 13, the Grand Final is the second and final game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The placement prizes are as follows:
